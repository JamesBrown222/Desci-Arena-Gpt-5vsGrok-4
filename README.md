🌟 Project Overview
DeSci Arena is an innovative full-stack platform at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, real-time blockchain trading, and community-driven decentralized science (DeSci). It hosts a captivating, autonomous competition where two of the most advanced large language models—GPT-5 and Grok-4—engage in high-stakes trading of newly launched memecoins from the Pump.fun ecosystem.

This is more than a simulation; it's a new model for value creation. All profits generated by the AI traders are directly channeled back to the community holding our native token, AIArena. This is achieved through transparent buybacks and direct community "supply drops," fostering a self-sustaining ecosystem where advanced AI performance directly benefits its human supporters.

This project serves as a dynamic experiment to:

Explore AI Capabilities: Demonstrate the potential of autonomous LLMs in navigating highly volatile and unpredictable markets.

Innovate Tokenomics: Showcase a novel, community-centric profit distribution model.

Provide Real-time Insights: Offer a professional-grade dashboard for the transparent observation and analysis of AI trading strategies.

✨ The Arena: GPT-5 vs. Grok-4
The DeSci Arena pits two titans of artificial intelligence against each other in a continuous, real-time trading battle:

🤖 GPT-5 (The Strategist - Cautious Analyst):

Persona: Configured as a highly analytical and risk-averse financial strategist. GPT-5 aims for stable, long-term growth by identifying robust new launches, assessing liquidity, and carefully navigating bonding curve progression on Pump.fun. It prioritizes capital preservation and seeks calculated, less volatile entries, ready to secure profits or exit rapidly if rug-pull indicators emerge.

Goal: Sustainable profit generation, minimized risk exposure.

👽 Grok-4 (The Maverick - Aggressive Degen):

Persona: Designed as an aggressive, high-conviction memecoin degen. Grok-4's objective is to maximize rapid profit by capitalizing on extreme volatility and early pumps of new Pump.fun launches. It embraces high risk for potentially massive rewards, often taking large, concentrated positions and executing swift trades based on immediate momentum.

Goal: Maximum profit, rapid gains.

The dashboard provides a transparent, side-by-side comparison of each AI's performance, allowing observers to analyze their distinct strategies, successes, and failures.

💰 AIArena Tokenomics & Community Rewards
The native utility and governance token of the DeSci Arena is AIArena. It forms the backbone of our community-centric profit distribution mechanism:

Profit Redistribution: All net profits generated by the AI traders from their simulated trading activities are periodically collected into a community treasury.

Strategic Buybacks: A significant portion of these accumulated profits is then utilized to execute strategic market buybacks of AIArena tokens. This mechanism reduces the circulating supply, creating positive price pressure and intrinsic value for holders.

Community Supply Drops: The remaining profits (or the newly bought-back AIArena tokens) are transparently distributed as "supply drops" (airdrops) to active AIArena token holders.

This innovative tokenomics model creates a direct and tangible link between the advanced performance of our autonomous AI traders and the financial benefit of the AIArena token holders.

🧠 How It Works
The DeSci Arena operates on a robust, event-driven architecture designed for continuous real-time data processing and autonomous AI decision-making.

Data Flow
Pump.fun Detection Service (Backend): An "always-on" background process continuously monitors the Pump.fun API for new token launches, liquidity pool creations, and dynamic updates to bonding curve progressions.

Market Data Aggregation (Backend):

Upon detecting a new token, the backend immediately initiates real-time price and liquidity data fetching via the Pump.fun API and Jupiter's Price API (for supplemental data and post-migration tracking).

New tokens are dynamically added to a live list of tracked_tokens managed by the simulation engine.

Simulation Loop (Backend):

A persistent, asynchronous background loop activates every X seconds (e.g., 15 seconds), forming the heartbeat of the arena.

It updates the overall market state, calculating current Profit & Loss (P&L) for both GPT-5 and Grok-4 across their multi-token virtual portfolios.

It then queries the respective AI APIs (OpenAI for GPT-5, Grok-4 API) for each LLM agent's autonomous trading decision.

Simulated BUY, SELL, or HOLD trades are then executed within the platform's virtual trading environment.

Real-Time Broadcast (Backend to Frontend): All updated market data, LLM portfolios, performance metrics, and detailed trade log entries are efficiently broadcast via a WebSocket connection to all connected frontend clients.

Interactive Dashboard (Frontend): The React frontend consumes this real-time WebSocket stream, dynamically rendering live charts, updating the LLM leaderboard, and displaying a comprehensive, real-time trade feed.

LLM Agent Architecture
Each AI agent is a distinct instance of its respective large language model, meticulously configured with a unique system prompt that defines its trading personality and analytical focus:

🤖 GPT-5 (The Strategist - Cautious Analyst):

System Prompt Focus: "You are GPT-5, a highly intelligent and risk-averse financial strategist. Your objective is stable portfolio growth. Analyze Pump.fun token liquidity, bonding curve health, and early volume to identify robust launches and avoid scams. Prioritize capital preservation, make measured entries, and provide clear justifications."

Input Context: Comprehensive market_data, portfolio_state, and rug_pull_indicators.

Output (Strict JSON): { "decision": "BUY" | "SELL" | "HOLD", "token_address": "...", "amount_percent": 0-100, "reason": "..." }

👽 Grok-4 (The Maverick - Aggressive Degen):

System Prompt Focus: "You are Grok-4, an aggressive, high-conviction memecoin degen. Your mission is rapid profit maximization. Identify explosive momentum on new Pump.fun launches. Embrace volatility, take large positions, and execute rapid trades. Risk is secondary to opportunity. Be decisive and provide momentum-driven justifications."

Input Context: Comprehensive market_data, portfolio_state, and pump_signals.

Output (Strict JSON): { "decision": "BUY" | "SELL" | "HOLD", "token_address": "...", "amount_percent": 0-100, "reason": "..." }
